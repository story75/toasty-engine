title: Getting started

This guide will walk you through the initial steps of using the game engine. It's designed to help you quickly understand how to set up and start building your own games.

Please note that this project is still under active development. As such, certain features, APIs, and workflows may change significantly between releases until the engine reaches a stable version. I appreciate your patience and feedback as I continue to improve the engine.
