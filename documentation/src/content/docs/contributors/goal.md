# Why Toasty?

This document outlines the main goals and ideas behind Toasty, explaining what makes it different from other game engines.

## The Goal: A 2D (and 2.5D) WebGPU Game Engine

> Toasty aims to be a WebGPU game engine specifically tailored for 2D (and 2.5D) games that can run on any device with a browser.

The primary goal is to create a game engine similar to RPG Maker, but with greater flexibility and control. While RPG Maker is excellent for learning game development basics and provides many tools, it can be restrictive, and games made with it are often easily recognizable.

Toasty aims to be different by providing:

*   A simple and easy-to-use engine for quick prototyping of pixel art games.
*   Enough flexibility and control to tweak almost every aspect of your game.
*   Built-in editors for levels and items, reducing the need for external tools like Tiled or spreadsheets.

## Target Audience

Toasty is primarily for those who want to create pixel art games, especially RPGs, but also other genres. While the engine will focus on making these aspects easy to use, it should also be possible to create other types of games.

Users should have some basic programming knowledge. While visual scripting and editors may be available, a basic understanding of programming is required.

## What Toasty Provides Out of the Box

Toasty will provide the following features to help you get started:

*   **Database Structure:** A robust database system for creating items, skills, enemies, and characters, with default values and structures to get you started quickly.
*   **Customizable Editors:** The ability to extend and modify the database and create custom editors, similar to Unity and Odin.
*   **Ready-to-Use Character:** A character with animations and basic behavior, so you can start creating your game right away.
*   **Visual Map and Scene Management:** Tools to create and manage maps and scenes visually, allowing you to tweak parameters and see changes in real-time.

## What is Out of Scope?

Toasty is not intended to be a general-purpose game engine like Unity or Godot. It is not designed for AAA games or 3D games.

The focus is on:

*   Pixel art games
*   Classic and modern RPGs
*   Simple 2D games

Toasty will provide minimal default assets, such as a character, icons, and prototype tiles. Users are expected to create their own assets for commercial projects.

I am a software developer with a passion for game development, especially the technical aspects. I want to understand how things work under the hood and create something new.

This is a long-term, mostly single-person project, but I welcome contributions and feedback.
