import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This guide will help you get started with developing and contributing to the project. It assumes you have some experience with web development and are comfortable with TypeScript.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following tools installed:

-   **[Bun](https://bun.sh/)**: A fast JavaScript runtime and package manager.
-   **[Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs)**: A high-performance build system for monorepos.
-   **[Biome](https://biomejs.dev/)**: A toolchain for web development, including a formatter and linter.
-   **[Astro Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/)**: A documentation site generator.

Take some time to familiarize yourself with these tools by visiting the links provided. They are essential for developing and contributing to the project.

The project is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and uses [WebGPU](https://www.w3.org/TR/webgpu/) for rendering.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

<FileTree>
- documentation/ Documentation site built with Astro Starlight
- examples/ Example projects demonstrating how to use Toasty
- infrastructure/ Infrastructure code for the project, such as the CLI
- packages/ Packages that make up the project
</FileTree>

## Understanding Packages

The project is divided into multiple packages, each treated as an independent project. This approach promotes separation of concerns and makes the project easier to manage.

Each package should have its own `README.md` file explaining its purpose and usage, as packages may be used independently.

Make sure to include relevant documentation comments using the [TSDoc](https://tsdoc.org/) standard.

More detailed documentation should be written in the Starlight documentation located in the `documentation` directory.
