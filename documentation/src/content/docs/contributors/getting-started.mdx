import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This guide will outline how to develop and contribute to the project. 
This guide assumes you know your way around web projects and are proficient in TypeScript.

## Prerequisites

This projects uses the following tools:
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs)
- [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/)
- [Astro Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/)

You can read up on these tools in the links provided. They are the tools that power the project and are essential to developing and contributing to the project.

The project is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and will use [WebGPU](https://www.w3.org/TR/webgpu/) for rendering.

## Directory structure

The project is structured as follows:

<FileTree>
- documentation/ Documentation site build with Astro Starlight
- examples/ Example projects that demonstrate how to use Toasty
- infrastructure/ Infrastructure code for the project like the CLI
- packages/ Packages that make up the project
</FileTree>

## Packages

The project is split into multiple packages. Treating each package as its own project allows for better separation of concerns
and makes it easier to manage the project.

Every project should thus contain a dedicated README file that explains the purpose of the package and how to use it,
because packages may be used in isolation outside the main project.

Include relevant doc comments according to the [TSDoc](https://tsdoc.org/) standard.

More thorough documentation should be written in the website here (located in the `documentation` directory).
