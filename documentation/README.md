# Toasty Engine Documentation

This package contains the documentation for the Toasty Engine, built using [Astro Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/).

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

The documentation is located in the `documentation/src/content/docs` directory. It uses Markdown (`.md`) and MDX (`.mdx`) files to create the documentation pages.

## ðŸ“– Documentation

This documentation is intended for **users** who want to build games with the Toasty Engine and **contributors** who want to help develop the engine. It includes guides, tutorials, and explanations of the engine's concepts and workflows.

**Technical documentation**, such as API references and detailed code explanations, is embedded directly within the codebase using TSDoc comments. This ensures that the technical documentation stays in sync with the code and is easily accessible to developers working on the engine.
